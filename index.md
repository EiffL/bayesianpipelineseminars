## Bayesian Forward Modeling Seminars

As part of the recently created LSST DESC Bayesian Pipelines Topical Team, we are organizing a series of community-wide open seminars on topics related to Bayesian Forward Modeling for the analysis of LSST data. The goal of these seminars, *open to anyone*, is to foster discussions of various modeling and technical aspects of a full end-to-end Bayesian pipeline. 

To join the seminar, follow this [zoom link](https://stanford.zoom.us/j/92410482859?pwd=STBNQXBrTS8yVGdydXJxVFViSGZOQT09).


Upcoming seminars:
