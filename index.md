## Bayesian Forward Modeling Seminars

As part of the recently created LSST DESC Bayesian Pipelines Topical Team, we are organizing a series of community-wide open seminars on topics related to Bayesian Forward Modeling for the analysis of LSST data. The goal of these seminars, *open to anyone*, is to foster discussions of various modeling and technical aspects of a full end-to-end Bayesian pipeline. 


Next seminars:

- **27th April, 2022**: *Galaxy SED Forward Modeling for Photometric Surveys* with guests [Andrew P. Hearin](https://www.anl.gov/profile/andrew-p-hearin), [ChangHoon Hahn](https://changhoonhahn.github.io/), and [Justin Alsing](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=ICPFL8AAAAAJ&hl=en).
